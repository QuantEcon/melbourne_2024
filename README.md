# University of Melbourne Scientific Computing Workshop

![](qe-logo-large.png)

This is the homepage for the computational economomics
workshop to be held at the University of Melbourne on August 15th 2024.

## Abstract

Several new open source scientific computing environments have appeared in
recent years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence
and related fields.  Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data
processing capabilities by exploiting these new computational tools.  This
workshop will provide a brief overview of core topics, including automatic
differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time compilers. We will discuss
how these tools can be applied to a range of economic applications.

All attendees should bring a laptop computer with access to the internet.

The workshop is suitable for people with interest in computational work but no
programming experience is required.


## Lead Instructor

* [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) (Australian National University)

John Stachurski is a mathematical and computational economist working at the
intersection of dynamic programming, probability theory, economics, and finance.
His research is published in journals such as the Journal of Finance, the
Journal of Economic Theory,  Econometrica, and Operations Research. In 2016 he
co-founded [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) with [Thomas J.
Sargent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Sargent). He has run workshops
on computational methods and high-performance computing at institutions such as
the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, as well
as universities including NYU, Columbia, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Yale,
Princeton and UCLA.
